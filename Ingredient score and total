#-------------------------------code with ingredient, unit, quantity------------

#A few premises

#In this section we will calculate the score for each ingredient that we will be
#having as an input written directly from the user

#df: name of the data table


#1: Make sure it is changed into integer
quantityin <- as.integer(quantityin)

#2:Calculate the CO2 score
#Selected is the row that finds a correspondence in the data-set based on the ingredient name and so on
#selected[,3] is the selection of the row 3, where the CO2 score is --> is it really on the third row? Or did something change
#textin, quantityin, unitin (names of the inputs)

selected1 <- df[df[,"ingredient"]==textin & df[,"unit"]==unitin,]
selected1[,3]

#3: Print the CO2 score
CO2score.output1<-selected[,3]*quantityin



#Has to be done for each line: CO2score.output2, CO2score.output3, ...
#Concerns:
- quantity measure
- Say something if one space is blank (my idea: if (length(textin) != 0 & length(unitin) == 0 || length(quantityin) == 0 {statement}



#-----------------------Total score---------------------------------------------
#A few premises

#Here we will have to calculate the total CO2 score for the recipe

#CO2score.output is the output's score found for each ingredient
#we sum them into TotalCO2score

TotalCO2score = sum(CO2score.output1, CO2score.output2, CO2score.output3, CO2score.output4)
